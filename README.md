# Medical Assistant Bot with RAG + Ollama

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system to answer user questions from a structured FAQ dataset. The system integrates **vector search with FAISS** and **large language model (LLM) generation (via Ollama + LangChain)** to provide concise, context-driven answers.

The workflow supports uploading FAQs , preprocessing, creating embeddings, building a retrieval index, and generating answers from retrieved documents only.

---

## Approach

1. **Data Upload & Preprocessing**

   * A CSV containing `question, answer` pairs is uploaded.
   * Each record is assigned a **record\_id** and grouped by **group\_id** (all answers belonging to the same question share a group).
   * The dataset is grouped by exact common questions ensuring balanced question distribution and grouping.

2. **Index Building (Ingestion)**

   * The training set is embedded using a sentence-transformer embedding model.
   * A **FAISS vector store** is built with embeddings and associated metadata (`record_id, group_id, question, answer`).

3. **Retrieval**

   * Given a user question, the system retrieves top candidate FAQs using FAISS cosine similarity.
   * Configurable parameters:

     * `fetch_k`: number of candidates retrieved from FAISS.
     * `top_k`: max. number of results added to the llm context to generate answer.
     * `similarity_threshold`: minimum similarity cutoff to consider a QnA as valid context.
     * `re_rank`: post fetching step to refine ordering of retrieved documents.

4. **Answer Generation**

   * Retrieved question-answer pairs are passed as **context** to the LLM.
   * The LLM (Ollama, via LangChain) generates an answer using only the provided context.
   * If context is insufficient, the system returns a message indicating that no reliable answer can be generated.

##  Assumptions

* **High Accuracy Expected**: Since this project provides a solution to a medical/clinical industry, there is very less margin to hallucination and incorrect answer generation.
* **FAQ style dataset**: Each record consists of a short question and one or more valid answers.
* **Context-bound answers**: The LLM must not use external general knowledgeâ€”answers must come from retrieved FAQs only.
* **Embedding quality**: The embedding model sufficiently captures semantic similarity between paraphrased questions as well as appropriately distinguishes between different medical topics.
* **Only Supports English Language**

---

## Model Performance

**Strengths**

* **Semantic retrieval**: Effectively surfaces similar FAQ entries even if user queries are paraphrased.
* **Context control**: Strictly generates answers from retrieved documents, improving reliability.
* **Open Source**: This project uses open source frameworks and data to implement the solution.
* **On-Prem Hosting**: This project does not utilize any premium paid enterprise or cloud app to serve.

**Weaknesses**

* **Quantized**: Since, to ensure that the model is hosted on-prem locally on a macbook 16 gb ram, we needed a 8 bit quantized system and compromise on the floating point precision.
* **Exact copying risk**: LLM sometimes copies retrieved answers instead of synthesizing them.
* **Ambiguity handling**: If retrieved documents contain multiple conflicting answers, the model may not resolve contradictions effectively.
* **Threshold sensitivity**: Performance can degrade if `similarity_threshold` is too strict (few/no docs returned) or too loose (irrelevant docs included).
* **Does not fix misspelt words in the User Query**

---

## Potential Improvements

* **Answer Fusion**: Implement an aggregation step to merge multiple retrieved answers into a more coherent response.
* **Fine-tuning**: Train a domain-specific embedding model for better semantic retrieval.
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Add retrieval metrics (Recall@k, Precision@k, MRR, nDCG) and answer-level metrics (BLEU/ROUGE/F1 against reference answers) by hand annotation or natural labeling performance test data.
* **Prompt Optimization**: Refine system prompts to encourage synthesis rather than verbatim copying.
* **Interactive Feedback Loop**: Allow users to rate answers, improving retrieval weights and answer generation over time to put Human-in-the-loop to validate the model output generation for Completeness, Correctness, Faithfulness.
* **Increased Floating Point Precision**: With better compute power to harness full potential of the llm model while inferencing, utilize higher/full bit floating point precision.
* **Rectify and Enhance User Prompt before Answering**: User Prompts can be misspelt and might not have enough information curated appropriately by the user for expected answer. Similar to chat-gpt, or any other responsive system, enhance and rectify the user prompt before using it for RAG context improvement and answer generation.

## Key Functions

### `upload_csv`

* Uploads a FAQ CSV file.
* Adds `record_id` and `group_id`.

### `ingest_data`

* Loads training data.
* Converts questions into embeddings.
* Builds and stores a FAISS index with metadata.

### `retrieve_similar`

* Retrieves top-k similar FAQ records based on user query.
* Supports configurable `fetch_k`, `top_k`, and `similarity_threshold`.

### `generate_answer`

* Performs RAG pipeline using FAISS retrieval + Ollama generation.
* Builds context prompt and generates an answer strictly from retrieved documents.
* Returns fallback if no sufficient context is found.
